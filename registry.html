        <h2>Wedding Gifts</h2>
        <p>We really appreciate that you want to gift us something to celebrate our wedding! Because we're not yet settled in permanent jobs or a permanent location, we decided not to have a traditional wedding registry. Instead, we are hoping for contributions to two important purchases we're saving for: our honeymoon in the United Kingdom, and buying a home. If you would rather get us something physical, we would of course also appreciate it. Our address is 236 Neponset Street, Apartment 2, Canton, MA 02021 for any mail or cards you want to send. Thank you so much! </p>
