        <h2>Travel</h2>
        <p>The wedding and reception will take place in Holliston, MA, which is a 45 minute drive from Logan Airport in Boston. If you're coming from out-of-state, we recommend renting a car to get around, but it's also possible to get close to the area by taking the Framingham / Worcester commuter rail or the Amtrak Lakeshore Limited to Framingham and then taking a ride share or cab to the area. </p>

        <h2>Lodging</h2>
        <p>We're not reserving a hotel block, but there are lots of hotel options in the neighboring towns of Framingham, Natick, and Milford that are within a 15 or 20 minute drive from the venue.</p>

        <h2>Transportation</h2>
        <p>There is plenty of parking both at the church and reception space. We also recommend street parking (free and plenty available) on Washington Street between the reception space and the church, which are a 10 minute walk from each other. If you take a rideshare or cab to the ceremony, it will be easy to walk from the church to the recepetion, or to catch a ride over with someone.
            <br> <br>
            We unfortunately won't be able to offer transportation to and from hotels, but we encourage carpooling! Closer to the date, we will help coordinate carpooling between the guests for those who are interested. Reach out to Jack or Caroline if you need help figuring out transportation!</p>
